## Abstract

What is the topic all about? What are we doing and why? What problem will this solve? What are the goals and non-goals? <br/>
This is your executive summary; keep it concrete and concise, elaborate below.

## Motivation

Why this is a valuable problem to solve? What background information is needed to show how this proposal addresses the problem?

Which users are affected by the problem? Why is it a problem? What data supports this? What related work exists?

## Introduction / Proposals / Benefits

Describe your topic in details. <br/>
How will people benefit from this work? How this can benefit your work?

## Code & Documents

Link to your code folder (for tool) or documents/slides (for Technique, Languages, Framework and Platform)

## Tutorials and Examples

- We should create end-to-end examples (ideally, a tutorial) which reflects how this tech/study will be used. Some things to consider related to the tutorial:
  - The minimum requirements for this are to consider how this would be used (prerequisites knowledge, preinstalled applications, ...).
  - This should be written as if it is documentation of the new user, not for experienced developers.

  ##### All the code and document/slide + tutorial/example should be uploaded in the same directory with the README.md file.
