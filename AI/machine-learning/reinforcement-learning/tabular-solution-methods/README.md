## Multi-arm Bandits
### Multiarm Bandits

#### An n-Armed bandit

RL uses training information that **evaluates** the actions taken rather than **instructs** by giving correct actions. You are faced repeatedly with a choice among ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?n) different actions. The original form is one-armed bandit, except that is has ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?n) levers instead of one. Your objective is to maximize the expected total reward over some time playing.

#### Action-Value Methods
We denote the true value of action ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?a) as ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?q(a)), and the estimated value on the ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?t)th time step ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?Q_t(a)).
