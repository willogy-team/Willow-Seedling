## Introduction

Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

# Paradigms comparison

|Paradigms | Reinforment learning | Supervised learning | Unsupervised learning |
|:----------| :----------|:----------|:----------|
|Learning method | Learning optimal stategy by trial and error | Learning to approximate reference answers| Learning underlying data structure|
|Need feedback| Do on agent's own actions | Do correct answers | No feedback required|
|Affect the input data |Agent can do| Do not | Do not |

## Motivation
