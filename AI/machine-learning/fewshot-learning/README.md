## Introduction

Few-shot learning is faced with limited data for training and need to verify the performance on the data for unseen classe

## Motivation

One of objective of few-shot learning is classification problem.

## Few-shot Learning Classification

One pupular choice solution for this problem  is to apply a meta learning on top of a pre-trained embedding network. Following this two stages paradigm but self-supervised learning to train
a large embedding network as our strong base.
