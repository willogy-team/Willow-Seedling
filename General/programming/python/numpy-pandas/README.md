## Introduction

Python is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages and has replaced many programming languages in the industry. The development of libraries has extended python's multi-purpose nature to solve machine learning problems as well. **Numpy** is the fundamental package for scientific computing what is considered as one of the most popular machine learning library in Python. Another ML library is **Pandas** that provides data structures of high-level and a wide variety of tools for analysis. One of the great feature of this library is the ability to translate complex operations with data using one or two commands. Pandas have so many inbuilt methods for grouping, combining data, and filtering, as well as time-series functionality.

## Motivation

Vectorization of `numpy` make code is more concise and easier to read, fewer lines, closely resembles standard mathematical notation, do fast. 

The entire process of manipulating data will be easier if use `pandas`. It support for operations such as re-indexing, iteration, sorting, aggregations, concatenations and visualizations are among the feature highlights of `pandas`. The data manipulation capabilities of `pandas` are built on top of the `numpy` library. 

## Numpy Library

### Load the library and check its version
```
import numpy as np
np.__version__
````
If you do not install `numpy`, or set up virtual enviroment, please read [link](~/python/virtualenv) 
## Pandas Library

## Matplotlib
