## Object-Oriented Programming

### Introduction

Different to procedural programming approach, which structures a program like a recipe in that it provides a set of steps, in the form of functions and code blocks, that flow sequentially in order to complete a task. Object-Oriented Programing(OOP) is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects. Put another way, object-oriented programming is an approach for modeling concrete, real-world things, like cars, as well as relations between things, like companies and employees, students and teachers, and so on. 

### Motivation

- Control program.
- Arrange code
- Easy to understand and modify
- Lend itself more to use.
